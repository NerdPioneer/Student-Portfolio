    NOTE: This navbar is NOT used in your main site. The working navbar is in index.html.
    The JS in main.js expects .nav-toggle, .nav-menu, .nav-link, and .hamburger-line classes.
    If you want to use this file, update its structure and classes to match index.html.
    Otherwise, you can ignore or delete this file.
